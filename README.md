# AVL_Tree
AVL tree implementation in C++ with some data files to test its performance.

Height with 10 nodes is 4
Height with 100 nodes is 6
Height with 1000 nodes is 10
Height with 5000 nodes is 12
Height with 9998 nodes is 13

And:

Log2(10) = 3.32
Log2(100) = 6.64
Log2(1000) = 9.97
Log2(5000) = 12.29
Log2(10000) = 13.29

So, the behavior is logarithmic
